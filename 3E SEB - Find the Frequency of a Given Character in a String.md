---

### AIM  
To create a Python program that finds the frequency of a given character in a string.


### ALGORITHM

1.	Begin the program.
2.	Use input() to read the string and the character to search for from the user.
3.	Use the count() method of the string to count the occurrences of the given character.
4.	Display the frequency of the character in the string.
5.	Terminate the program.


### PROGRAM

```

x=input()
y=input()
print("Character",y,"in the",x,"is",x.count(f"{y}"),"times")
